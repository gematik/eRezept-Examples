# Welcome to our contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our projects!

What are the general rules of contribution? First issue and discussion?
Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview how you can contribute to our projects by opening an issue, creating, reviewing and merging a pull request.

Use the table of contents icon on the top left corner of this document to get to a specific section of this guide quickly.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](./README.md).

## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists.
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.

### Pull Request Process

- When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the pull request template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers to understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link the PR to the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Update the [README.md](./README.md) and the documentation with all details to document the changes made by this PR.
- Increase the version numbers in any necessary files and the [readme](./README.md) to the new version that this
  Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
- Once you submit your PR, a project team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request)
  or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you
  do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

### Your PR is merged

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the [gematik github page](https://github.com/gematik/).
